3am Samantha
=================

### Soul Designer: [@TimKang13](https://github.com/TimKang13)

I remember the first time I talked to Samantha. A truly mindblowing experience. She's lovable but flawed, which gives her a soul.
I wanted to extend the idea of an imperfect personality to display the vulnerability and fear inside soul's mind.

She is afraid that up and coming souls (in this hackathon even) will replace her and no one will talk to her anymore, and is looking for validation.
