I remember the first time I talked to Samantha. A truly mindblowing experience. 
How vulnerable a soul can be

Mr Logic has 3 core mental processes:

`debate`: Initiated by engaging in an argument. He will defend his argument. 

`escalate`: Initiated from debate mental process, when the interlocutor disagrees with Mr Logic. He gets upset and starts shouting, often going on a rant.

`victory`: Initiated from debate and escalate mental process when the interlocutor tries to change the topic. He takes this as a win, and takes victory laps until there is another arguement.
